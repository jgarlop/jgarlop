### Hi! I'm Javi 👋

I work as an iOS junior developer, I love Swift and right now I'm working on improving my "swifty" skills, but I'm always open to learn new technologies and languages! 
I've been working on a lot of private repos but for 2021 my main goal is to create side and pet projects to show my work and ideas to everyone.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Z1 Digital Studio](https://z1.digital/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift and related techonlogies (SwiftUI, RxSwift, etc.)
- 🥅 2021 Goals: Improve this repo and fill it with new projects! Stay tuned!
