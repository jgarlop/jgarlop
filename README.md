### Hi! I'm Javi ðŸ‘‹

I work as an iOS mid-senior developer, I love Swift and right now I'm working on improving my "swifty" skills, but I'm always open to learn new technologies and languages! 
I've been working on a lot of private repos but for 2023 my main goal is to create side and pet projects to show my work and ideas to everyone.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [The Wabi project](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wabi-project/mycompany/)
- ðŸŒ± Learning Swift and related techonlogies (SwiftUI, RxSwift, etc.)
